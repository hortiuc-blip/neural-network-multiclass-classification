## Multiclass Neural Network for Digit Recognition
Personal practice project focused on implementing and analyzing
a neural network for handwritten digit recognition (0–9).
### Key topics:
- Multiclass classification
- ReLU and Softmax
- Neural networks with TensorFlow
- Practical ML experimentation
Status:
Learning / Personal project

### Project structure
- nn_multiclass_digits_personal.ipynb — main notebook with model implementation and experiments
- README.md — project overview
### My contribution
- Modified and extended the original notebook
- Performed additional experiments with model parameters
- Added personal analysis and conclusions
### Next steps
- Experiment with deeper architectures
- Add regularization techniques
- Compare performance with different optimizers
